Customer Churn Analysis using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python project focused on predicting Customer Churn using various machine learning algorithms. The project applies data cleaning, feature engineering, and builds several machine learning models to analyze customer churn behavior. The goal is to identify factors that contribute to customer churn and build a model that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave.
